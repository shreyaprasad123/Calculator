This repository contains a simple yet powerful calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease and accuracy. Whether you're a beginner learning to code or a developer seeking a lightweight utility, this calculator offers a clean and modular structure that’s easy to understand and extend.
The application supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with input validation and error handling to ensure smooth user experience. It’s implemented in Python and includes both a command-line interface (CLI) and an optional graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it accessible for users who prefer either mode of interaction.
The codebase is organized for clarity, with separate modules for core logic and utility functions. This modularity allows for easy integration into larger projects or enhancement with advanced features like scientific functions, history tracking, or expression parsing.
Ideal for educational purposes, quick calculations, or as a foundation for more complex tools, this calculator is lightweight, dependency-free (except for GUI), and cross-platform compatible. Contributions are welcome, and the project is open-source under the MIT License.
Explore the code, run the app, and feel free to customize it to suit your needs. Let this calculator be your starting point for building smarter tools.
